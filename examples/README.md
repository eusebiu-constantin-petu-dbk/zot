The behavior of _zot_ registry is controlled via its configuration file, which
can either be a JSON (used in details below) or YAML file.

```
zot serve <config-file>

```

A candidate configuration file can be verified via:

```
zot verify <config-file>

```

Examples of working configurations for various use cases are available [here](../examples/)

# Configuration Parameters

* [Network](#network)
* [Storage](#storage)
* [Authentication](#authentication)
* [Identity-based Authorization](#identity-based-authorization)
* [Logging](#logging)
* [Metrics](#metrics)


## Network

Configure network params with:
```
"http": {
```

Configure address and port to listen on with:
```
        "address": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "5000",
```

Additionally, TLS configuration can be specified with:

```
        "tls": {
            "cert":"test/data/server.cert",
            "key":"test/data/server.key"
        },
```

The registry can be deployed as a read-only service with:

```
        "ReadOnly": false
    },
```

## Storage

Configure storage with:

```
"storage": {
```

Configure storage root directory with:

```
        "rootDirectory": "/tmp/zot",
```

Often, container images have shared layers and blobs and for filesystems that
support hard links, inline deduplication can be enabled with:

```
        "dedupe": true,
```

When an image is deleted (either by tag or reference), orphaned blobs can lead
to wasted storage, and background garbage collection can be enabled with:

```
        "gc": true,
```

It is also possible to store and serve images from multiple filesystems with
their own repository paths, dedupe and garbage collection settings with:

```
        "subPaths": {
            "/a": {
                "rootDirectory": "/tmp/zot1",
                "dedupe": true,
                "gc": true
            },
            "/b": {
                "rootDirectory": "/tmp/zot2",
                "dedupe": true
            },
            "/c": {
                "rootDirectory": "/tmp/zot3",
                "dedupe": false
            }
        }
    },
```

## Authentication

TLS mutual authentication and passphrase-based authentication are supported.

### TLS Mutual Authentication

Apart from the server cert and key specified under
[network configuration](#network), specifying the _cacert_ field enables TLS mutual
authentication:

```
"http": {
    "tls": {
      "cert":"test/data/server.cert",
      "key":"test/data/server.key",
      "cacert":"test/data/cacert.cert"
    },
```

### Passphrase Authentication

**Local authentication** is supported via htpasswd file with:

```
  "http": {
    "auth": {
      "htpasswd": {
        "path": "test/data/htpasswd"
      },
```

**LDAP authentication** can be configured with:

```
  "http": {
    "auth": {
      "ldap": {
        "address":"ldap.example.org",
        "port":389,
        "startTLS":false,
        "baseDN":"ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org",
        "userAttribute":"uid",
        "bindDN":"cn=ldap-searcher,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=org",
        "bindPassword":"ldap-searcher-password",
        "skipVerify":false,
        "subtreeSearch":true
      },
```

NOTE: When both htpasswd and LDAP configuration are specified, LDAP authentication is given preference.

**OAuth2 authentication** (client credentials grant type) support via _Bearer Token_ configured with:

```
  "http": {
    "auth": {
      "bearer": {
        "realm": "https://auth.myreg.io/auth/token",
        "service": "myauth",
        "cert": "/etc/zot/auth.crt"
      }
```

#### Authentication Failures

Should authentication fail, to prevent automated attacks, a delayed response can be configured with:

```
  "http": {
    "auth": {
      "failDelay": 5
```

## Identity-based Authorization

Allowing actions on one or more repository paths can be tied to user
identities. An additional per-repository default policy can be specified for
identities not in the whitelist. Furthermore, a global admin policy can also be
specified which can override per-repository policies.

```
"accessControl": {
    "repos1/repo": {
        "policies": [
        {
            "users": ["alice", "bob"],
            "actions": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
        },
        {
            "users": ["mallory"],
            "actions": ["create", "read"]
        }
        ],
        "defaultPolicy": ["read"]
    },
    "repos2/repo": {
        "policies": [
        {
            "users": ["bob"],
            "actions": ["read", "create"]
        },
        {
            "users": ["mallory"],
            "actions": ["create", "read"]
        }
        ],
        "defaultPolicy": ["read"]
    },
    "adminPolicy": {
        "users": ["admin"],
        "actions": ["read", "create", "update", "delete"]
    }
}
```

## Logging

Enable and configure logging with:

```
"log":{
```

Set log level with:

```
    "level":"debug",
```

Set output file (default is _stdout_) with:

```
    "output":"/tmp/zot.log",
```

Enable audit logs and set output file with:

```
    "audit": "/tmp/zot-audit.log"
  }
```

## Metrics

Enable and configure metrics with:

```
"metrics":{
    "enable":"true",

```

Set server path on which metrics will be exposed:

```
    "prometheus": {
      "path": "/metrics"
    }
}
```

In order to test the Metrics feature locally in a [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster, folow [this guide](metrics/README.md).

## Storage Drivers

Beside filesystem storage backend, zot also supports S3 storage backend, check below url to see how to configure it:
- [s3](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/storage-drivers/s3.md): A driver storing objects in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.

For an s3 zot configuration with multiple storage drivers see: [s3-config](config-s3.json).

zot also supports different storage drivers for each subpath.

### Specifying S3 credentials

There are multiple ways to specify S3 credentials:

- Config file: 

```
        "storageDriver": {
            "name": "s3",
            "region": "us-east-2",
            "bucket": "zot-storage",
            "secure": true,
            "skipverify": false,
            "accesskey": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
            "secretkey": "<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
        }
```

- Environment variables:

SDK looks for credentials in the following environment variables:

```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)
```

- Credentials file:

A credential file is a plaintext file that contains your access keys. The file must be on the same machine on which youâ€™re running your application. The file must be named credentials and located in the .aws/ folder in your home directory.

```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_DEFAULT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

    [test-account]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_TEST_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_TEST_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

    [prod-account]
    ; work profile
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_PROD_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_PROD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

The [default] heading defines credentials for the default profile, which the SDK will use unless you configure it to use another profile.

To specify a profile use AWS_PROFILE environment variable:

```
AWS_PROFILE=test-account
```
